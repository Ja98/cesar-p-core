Requirements Overview
---------------------
The researcher wants to generate energy demand data for a district or city using EnergyPlus as a building simulation tool. With Cesar he can generate simulation input data for several buildings by using different data sources, some of them pre-defined. There are also options for considering retrofit. Thereafter the energy plus simulation can be run and results aggregated.



Feature overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first group of use cases focuses on assigning and preparing the simulation input, the second group describes the interaction with EnergyPlus for running multiple simulations and finally there is the result postprocessing.
