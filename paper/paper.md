# Summary

Buildings are responsible for a large share of energy consumption and car-bon dioxide emissions. With the challenge of reducing energy consumption and integrating renewable energy sources in buildings and neighbourhoods, an understanding of energy consumption patterns is needed at different tem-poral and spatial scales. 
CESAR-P (Combined Energy Simulation And Retrofitting - Python) is a bottom-up building stock modelling software to evaluate energy consumption and retrofitting strategies for buildings and neighbourhoods. CESAR-P is used to parameterize models for the dynamic building energy simulation tool En-ergyPlus (@CRAWLEY_ET_AL_2001). It computes hourly energy demand profiles and indoor temperatures at the individual building scale and takes into ac-count shading and reflections of surrounding buildings. After the current energy demand is computed, retrofitting measures for individual buildings can be evaluated in terms of energy savings, embodied emissions and costs. The default library of CESAR-P is based on Swiss archetypal buildings cre-ated from standards and statistics about the Swiss building stock; however, users are able to define their own constructions and internal conditions for their buildings. CESAR-P is written in Python and is a further develop-ment of the tool CESAR (@WANG_ET_AL_2018). The building model generator of CESAR-P creates EnergyPlus input data files (IDF) for each building within a specified extent, and can process geo-referenced input data (shp) for ge-ometry. Building usage type and construction information is used to populate the building model. The EnergyPlus files are executed with a weather file (epw) of the geographic location which provides the necessary climatic context of the building. The results from EnergyPlus consist of a set of hourly resolved times series for each building, including operational ener-gy, costs and emissions. The retrofit module can be used to update the building models according to a specified retrofit strategy. Retrofit strat-egies specify the frequency of retrofits to the main building elements such as walls, windows and roofs across the building stock. The output of the retrofit module include next to the before-mentioned operational indicators also costs and embodied emissions of retrofitting interventions. All simu-lation steps can also be run in parallel on multiple cores. The code is platform-independent and is tested to run on Linux and Windows. The source code for Cesar-P has been archived to Zenodo: [@cesar-p-zenodo]


# Statement of need and Key features

Building energy simulation is required and compelling, as current energy demand profiles of buildings are often not readily available or the build-ing performance needs to be studied for varying conditions (e.g. building retrofit, changing climate). CESAR-P simplifies the process of building simulation model generation by automatically generating input files for the open-source building simulation tool EnergyPlus with only a few key input parameters needed. Key features of CESAR-P include:

- The modelling of indoor temperatures, heating and cooling loads, do-mestic hot water consumption, electricity consumption, comfort param-eters, operational costs and emissions, embodied emissions and in-vestment costs of retrofitting solutions and solar irradiance on ex-ternal surfaces.
- Various geo-referenced data sources can be used as an input to CESAR-P to simulate the current energy demand as well as retrofitting op-tions for each building.
- Since CESAR-P uses EnergyPlus, which is a continually developed ener-gy simulation tool within the research field, the capabilities of CE-SAR-P can be extended to accommodate future develoments and improve modelling accuracy. 
- The tool can be applied at various scales and can be used for pre-dicting the energy consumption of a single building, of whole neigh-bourhoods with thousands of buildings (@WANG_ET_AL_2018) or in combi-nation with clustering approaches for calculating national building energy demands (@EGGIMANN_ET_AL_2022).
- The archetypes used to parameterize the building models are stored to a graph database. The data is structured according to an urban energy simulation ontology (@ALLAN_ET_AL_2021)
- CESAR-P has been used for national scale energy simulation in combi-nation with clustering approaches (@MURRAY_ET_AL_2020, @EGGIMANN_ET_AL_2022).
